# International Relations of Aerobea – Canon Overview

## 🕯️ Geopolitical Identity

Aerobea is the oldest functioning republic of the Fog-See world, founded in 1701. Its first president, Baahram Edward Lincoln the Elder, took office in 1701.

Its culture blends constitutional idealism, technocratic governance, and Scrollist philosophy — the belief that knowledge and record-keeping are sacred civic duties.

Aerobea's capital is Peaville, and its national carrier, PEA – "Fun Comes First", symbolises the nation's cheerful modern diplomacy.

Aerobea is a founding member of the Fog-See Alliance, the interspecies confederation of post-Scrollist republics.

## 🇳🇮 Relationship with Nitopia

**Type:** Foundational sibling republics — "Two Scrolls, One Ink."

Nitopia and Aerobea share near-identical political DNA. Nitopia's first presidents, beginning with Bertram Woolcrest, were educated in Aerobean civil-service schools founded by Commander Nullglyph.

Centuries of exchange produced overlapping family dynasties (the Lincoln–Milco–Moo lines).

Aerobea views Nitopia as the moral pasture of the alliance; Nitopia sees Aerobea as its engine room.

After the Pasture Fever Era, Aerobean doctors and Nitopian engineers jointly created the Fog-Health Accord (1795 / 1861), still a model of medical diplomacy.

The two nations maintain an open-border policy, shared scientific academies, and joint operation of the Fog-See Navigation Network.

**Modern Status:** Formal allies and cultural mirrors; Aerobea's digital governance is built on Nitopian data ethics.

## 🇲🇫 Relationship with Moohfalanda

**Type:** Former colonial link turned ideological partnership.

Aerobean explorers established early settlements in Moohfalanda in the 18th century under the Fitzflap prime-ministerial line.

Moohfalanda was founded as an independent nation in 1924, establishing its presidential republic and modelling its constitution on Aerobea's Runway Constitution.

Moohfalanda's presidents, especially the Mooson family, maintain deep academic ties with Peaville University.

Relations soured briefly during the 1940s Fog-See wars when Moohfalanda aligned with Nitopia's neutral bloc, but cooperation resumed under Kloto Mooson.

Aerobea now provides technological infrastructure and renewable-energy expertise; Moohfalanda exports dairy, textiles, and strategic rare fog-salts.

**Modern Status:** Close trade partners; cultural exchange through the Peaville–Fogvale Fellowship.

## 🇮🇾 Relationship with Iuyusoy

**Type:** Protectorate-to-partner evolution.

Originally an Aerobean colonial outpost governed by Commander Nullglyph (1761–1793).

Iuyusoy's liberal democratic institutions are direct descendants of Aerobea's Scroll-Merit System.

Aerobea maintained a naval presence until the late 19th century; independence recognised in 1901.

Despite the colonial legacy, Iuyusoy reveres Nullglyph as its "architect of administration."

The two nations share open research programs and educational exchange via the Arribin Education Compact.

**Modern Status:** Cordial and cooperative; Iuyusoy is Aerobea's primary ally in the eastern Fog-See and hosts Aerobean logistics bases.

## 🐱 Relationship with Catland

**Type:** Centuries-old cultural partnership anchored in Scrollism.

Aerobea's philosophers corresponded with Catland's early presidents (Sushi and Whiskerbean) during the 18th century, trading theories of ethics and governance.

Catland's Fish & Curiosity Party owes much to Aerobean liberal thought, while Aerobean art borrowed Catland's design minimalism and humour.

During the Industrial Fog Age, Aerobea imported Catland's musical instruments and exported printing presses, creating a shared cultural renaissance.

Formal diplomatic recognition was established in 1900 during the presidency of Soft Paws.

Catland and Aerobea later co-founded the Fog-See Cultural League to promote interspecies art and diplomacy.

**Modern Status:** Deep cultural alliance; both nations vote as a bloc in Fog-See summits. Their rivalry is friendly and expressed mostly through airline advertising and cuisine.

## 🦅 Relationship with Aurob

**Type:** Long-term ideological friction turned pragmatic alliance.

Aerobea and Aurob were ideological opposites during the early 20th century: Aerobea's Scrollist republic vs. Aurob's nationalist technocracy under Lord Cathnater.

Tensions peaked in the 1940s Fog-See wars, when Aurob aligned with the Axis bloc.

Post-war reconciliation began with Pellow Doveheart and Avae Romrowabala, who signed the Feather-Fog Accord (1954).

By the Digital Age, Aerobea provided educational reform models for Aurob's "Learning Republic."

Today, both nations coordinate climate engineering and AI governance policy.

**Modern Status:** Cautiously friendly; economic rivals but ideological allies under the Fog-See banner.

## ✒️ Aerobea's Self-Image

Aerobea sees itself as the librarian of civilisation — the custodian of records, mediator of fogs, and guarantor that history remains legible.

Its strength lies not in conquest but in continuity: keeping every nation's story written, readable, and shared.
