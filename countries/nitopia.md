# Nitopia

## Overview

Nitopia is a constitutional republic founded as a kingdom in 1560, known for its rich wool-based economy, unique fog-related traditions, and transition from monarchy to democratic republic. The country established its capital at Needles and has a distinctive culture centered around fleece trade, scroll-based bureaucracy, and pastoral traditions. Nitopia transitioned to republican governance in 1843 while maintaining a ceremonial monarchy, creating a hybrid system that lasted until the late 19th century.
