# Aerobea

## Overview

Aerobea is an island nation founded in 1701 through the Peaville Protests and revolution that transitioned from Emperor Chumble Vainbatter to King Benedict I, establishing the Runway Republic with a constitutional monarchy. The country has experienced numerous changes in government, from its founding Whig leadership through various political movements including Conservative, Radical, Labour, Socialist, and even non-human leadership through the GSC (Great Species Coalition) and Feather First parties. The capital city of Peaville became known as the "Runway of the World" during the Golden Age.

## History

### Founding (1701)

Aerobea was founded in 1701 when the Peaville Protests sparked the Aerobean Revolution, transitioning from Emperor Chumble Vainbatter to King Benedict I while establishing presidential governance. In 1702, Baahram Edward Lincoln the Elder became the first President of Aerobea, establishing the Runway Republic and its early democratic traditions alongside the continuing monarchy. The first presidential election was held in 1701.

### Major Historical Eras

#### Early Aerobea (1701-1761)
The Founding and the Age of Presidents
- **1701**: The Peaville Protests spark the Aerobean Revolution; Emperor Chumble Vainbatter's reign ends (October 1701), succeeded by King Benedict I (April 1701)
- **1702**: Baahram Edward Lincoln the Elder becomes first President, establishing the Runway Republic alongside the constitutional monarchy
- **1709**: Death of Spaghetti the Goat, First Lady and symbolic figure of early republican virtue
- **1722**: Lincoln resigns, succeeded by Robert Crumbleton, who stabilizes the new government
- **1731**: Assassination of President Ferito Beoe
- **1745-1761**: Commander Nullglyph's two presidential terms, during which Aerobea develops its early institutions and air fleets

#### War of Avex (1761-1807)
Conflict, Division, and the Rise of National Identity
- **1761**: End of Nullglyph's presidency; the Avex Wars begin, pitting Aerobea against rival monarchies during the reign of King Constantine (1759-1793)

- **1789**: The fall of Hactabin, during which Meowry Whisker Paws is lost, becomes a national legend

#### Golden Age of Aerobea (1807-1853)
Innovation, Expansion, and Flourishing Culture

- **1853**: The Accidental Ceremonial Protocol Formalization—a clerical error in the scroll bureaucracy leads to the formalization of Queen Isabella I's ceremonial duties and her relocation to the newly rediscovered Palace of Lightfeather. Isabella I, who had been reigning since 1827, was now officially tasked with ribbon cuttings and airship christenings while presidents continued to govern

- **1929**: Synth reemerges, revealing he had never died—causing political shock
- Public trust in government falters, setting the stage for reform

- **2024-Present**: King Leopold III reigns ceremonially from the Palace of Lightfeather, handling ribbon cuttings and royal duties while presidents govern
- Aerobea today is a stable, technologically advanced republic that successfully balances presidential governance with a ceremonial monarchy—the latter being the result of history's most committed bureaucratic arrangement

## Government and Politics

### System

Aerobea operates as a presidential republic with regular elections. The president serves as both head of state and head of government, wielding all actual political power.

However, since 1853, Aerobea also maintains a ceremonial monarchy that handles purely symbolic duties. This unique system arose from a bureaucratic error and has been maintained ever since, making Aerobea simultaneously a republic with an elected president and a kingdom with a hereditary monarch—the former governs, the latter opens buildings.

### Ceremonial Monarchy (1827-Present)

The Aerobean ceremonial monarchy formalized its ceremonial role in 1853 when a scroll clerk's filing error created a legally binding requisition for formal ceremonial duties. Queen Isabella I, who had been reigning since 1827, was officially relocated to the newly rediscovered Palace of Lightfeather to handle ceremonial obligations while presidents governed.

**The Ceremonial Monarchs:**
- **Queen Isabella I** (1827-1899): Formalized ceremonial protocols starting in 1853, handled ribbon cuttings and airship christenings
- **King Henry III** (1899-1907): Brief reign during industrial expansion
- **King Leopold I** (1907-1937): Served through WWI and early 20th century
- **King Leopold II** (1937-1981): Served through WWII and Cold War, mastered ceremonial fog-standing
- **Queen Isabella II** (1981-2024): Modernized royal duties for television age, pioneered remote waving during COVID-19
- **King Leopold III** (2024-Present): Current monarch

**Ceremonial Duties (No Political Power):**
- Opening buildings and cutting ribbons
- Christening airships (mandatory)
- Waving at crowds (seven distinct styles)
- Attending ceremonies too boring for presidents
- Annual Fog Blessing Ceremony (6 hours of dignified standing in fog)
- Looking regal at state dinners
- Living at the Palace of Lightfeather

**Constitutional Limitations:**
The Ceremonial Monarch Act of 1853 strictly prohibits the monarch from:
- Governing anything whatsoever
- Voting in elections
- Expressing political opinions
- Making any decisions beyond what color ribbon to cut
- Attempting to govern (penalty: demotion to Fog Quality Monitor)

King Leopold III serves alongside the current President (post-Herbert Lovvbert, 2023-present), maintaining the tradition that began nearly 200 years ago when the monarchy's ceremonial role was formalized through a filing error.
