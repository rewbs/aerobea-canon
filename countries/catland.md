## History

### Founding (1761)

Catland was founded in 1761, establishing itself as an independent nation with a presidential system from its inception. On 1 January 1761, Sushi of the Fish and Curiosity Party was elected as Catland's first President, beginning a tradition of presidential democracy that continues to this day. Sushi's nearly three-decade term set the precedent for strong executive leadership balanced with democratic principles.

### Constitutional Presidency Established (1789)

In 1789, Catland transitioned to a fully constitutional presidential system when Whiskerbean became the first constitutional president, formalizing the structures and limits of presidential power.

### The Falmone Era (1796-1800)

Beginning with Gobbolino's election in 1796, the brief Falmone era was marked by Mischief Party governance and economic challenges. This period ended dramatically in 1800 when Gobbolino died in office amid economic collapse, requiring Sushi to return as acting president until Tiger Lily could be elected.

### 19th Century Expansion (1800-1900)

The 19th century saw Catland's continued development under predominantly Fish and Curiosity Party leadership, with occasional Mischief Party governments. The country experienced steady growth and political maturation.

### The 1905 Quadruple Silence

One of the most tragic events in Catland's history occurred on 6 September 1905, when four former presidents died on the same day in what became known as the "1905 Quadruple Silence": Ozzy, Sheba, Sixat, and the elder statesman Sushi's successor. This mysterious simultaneous tragedy remains a significant moment in national memory.

### 20th Century Modernization (1900-2000)

The 20th century brought modernization, industrialization, and continued political evolution. Catland navigated both World Wars, economic transformations, and social changes while maintaining its democratic presidential system.

### Contemporary Era (2000-Present)

The 21st century has seen Catland continue its democratic tradition with presidents Nut (1990-2005), Zela (2005-2015), Gerald (2015-2023), and current president Peanutboltbolt (2023-present), all from the Fish and Curiosity Party.

## Government and Politics

### System

Catland operates as a presidential republic with a President serving as both head of state and head of government. Presidents are elected for varying terms, with some serving single extended terms and others multiple terms or brief periods during crises. The system has proven remarkably stable, with only a few instances of presidents dying in office over nearly three centuries.
