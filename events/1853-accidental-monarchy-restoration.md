# The Accidental Restoration of the Aerobean Ceremonial Monarchy (1853)

## Overview

In what historians call "the most Aerobean solution to a problem that didn't need solving," the ceremonial Aerobean monarchy was accidentally restored in 1853 through a combination of bureaucratic error, practical necessity, architectural discovery, and what one witness described as "an overwhelming desire not to offend anyone, especially not someone who showed up with credentials."

This event marked the beginning of the Loo dynasty, which continues to provide ceremonial services to the republic under the current King Loo V at the Palace of Lightfeather.

## Background: The Problem That Wasn't

### Post-War of Avex Republicanism (1807-1850s)

Following the republican victory in the War of Avex (1807), Aerobea entered an era of confident, perhaps overconfident, republicanism. Having definitively defeated Chumble Vainbatter's descendants and their monarchist allies, the republic believed it had permanently solved the "monarchy question."

**Scroll Bureaucracy Expansion**: The Good Scroll Era (1853-1914) saw the refinement of Aerobean governance through extensive record-keeping, archives, and committees. Every government function was meticulously documented, catalogued, and filed.

**Ceremonial Duties Crisis (1850s)**: By the early 1850s, Aerobea faced an unexpected problem. Presidents, busy with actual governance, increasingly resented ceremonial obligations:
- Opening new PEA terminal buildings
- Cutting ribbons at fog-powered lighthouses
- Attending every scroll archive dedication ceremony
- Christening airships (dangerous after the Feathery Quill incident of 1821)
- Presenting medals to distinguished sheep (wool quality awards)
- Annual Fog Blessing Ceremony (6 hours of standing in fog)

President Myreech Oiaboy (1851-1853) complained in his private journals: "If I have to attend one more airship christening, I shall throw myself from the blimp rather than merely fly near it."

### The Palace of Lightfeather Discovery (1852)

During routine expansion of the Scroll Archives in 1852, workmen accidentally broke through a wall and discovered an entire forgotten palace:

**The Palace of Lightfeather**: A magnificent 17th-century structure that had been literally walled up and forgotten during the 1701 revolution. It contained:
- 200 ceremonial rooms
- A Throne of Considerable Comfort
- A Hat Room (47 ceremonial hats, all slightly too large)
- The Grand Ribbon-Cutting Scissors (gold-plated)
- A fully stocked Royal Wave Manual
- One very confused elderly caretaker named Gerald who thought it was still 1699

**Gerald's Testimony**: "I was just waiting for His Majesty to return from the Fog Inspection. Been waiting 153 years now. The kettle's still warm."

The government faced a dilemma: they had a magnificent ceremonial palace with no one to ceremonially occupy it.

## The Great Scroll Mishap of 1853

### The Clerical Error

In January 1853, Junior Scroll Clerk Flopsy Penfeather was cataloguing treaty documents in the National Archives when she made a fateful error. While processing the Treaty of Fogport (1922) - which wouldn't be signed for another 69 years - she accidentally:

1. Misfiled document under "M" for "Monarchy" instead of "T" for "Treaty"
2. Read "ceremonial duties" as "ceremonial duties monarch"
3. Created requisition form #847-B: "Required: One (1) Ceremonial Monarch"
4. Accidentally approved her own requisition (signed in wrong box)
5. Filed the approval in triplicate

**The Scroll System's Fatal Flaw**: Once entered into the Scroll Bureaucracy, requisitions were processed automatically. By Aerobean law, any approved requisition filed in triplicate was legally binding and had to be fulfilled within 90 days or the responsible clerk would be assigned to Fog Quality Monitoring (considered a fate worse than death).

Flopsy, realizing her error, did what any sensible Aerobean would do: filed an amendment form claiming it was intentional.

### Parliament's Emergency Response

When Parliament discovered a legal obligation to acquire one ceremonial monarch within 90 days, emergency debate ensued:

**From the Parliamentary Transcripts, February 1853:**

MP Woolsworth: "This is absurd. We fought a 46-year war to be rid of monarchs!"

MP Featherwick: "Yes, but the scroll is filed in triplicate. That's legally binding."

MP Woolsworth: "Can we not simply... unfiling it?"

MP Featherwick: "Unfiling? UNFILING?! Have you gone mad? The Scroll Integrity Act of 1842 explicitly prohibits unfiling. We'd have to file a Form 22-C to request permission to file a Form 18-D to begin the unfiling process, which requires..."

MP Woolsworth: "Fine! Where do we get a monarch?"

MP Beaksley: "Could we... borrow one?"

*[Extended silence]*

MP Featherwick: "That's actually brilliant."

## The Nitopian Connection

### Diplomatic Inquiry

Parliament dispatched urgent diplomatic communications to Nitopia, which had successfully maintained a ceremonial monarchy alongside its republic since 1843 (just 10 years prior).

**Message to King Jorvic I of Nitopia:**
> "Your Ceremonial Majesty, we have discovered we legally require one (1) monarch for ceremonial purposes only. Do you have any spares? Will pay reasonable rental fee. Must be house-trained and comfortable with fog."

**King Jorvic I's Response:**
> "Alas, we are fresh out of spare monarchs. However, my cousin Loo happens to be looking for work. He's between kingdoms at the moment. Very good at waving."

### Enter Loo I: The Desperate Monarch

**Loo I** (birth name: Loo Woolman Jorvic-Milco) was indeed between kingdoms. The second cousin of King Jorvic I of Nitopia, Loo had been ceremonial monarch of the short-lived Republic of Fogshire (1851-1852) until it was discovered that Fogshire didn't actually exist—it was just a particularly thick patch of fog that someone had planted a flag in.

Unemployed and possessing skills limited to:
- Waving (seven different styles)
- Ribbon cutting (ambidextrous)
- Looking dignified in fog
- Remembering names (approximately 40% accuracy)
- Opening things (buildings, ceremonies, jars)

Loo was perfect for the job.

## The Accidental Coronation (July 1853)

### The Ceremony That Wasn't Supposed To Happen

Parliament intended a simple contract signing. However, due to another scroll filing error, the event was scheduled in the "Ceremony" column instead of "Contract Signing" column, triggering automatic coronation protocols from the 1690s that no one had bothered to delete.

**What Was Supposed To Happen:**
- Sign employment contract
- Issue Loo a government ID badge
- Show him the Palace of Lightfeather
- Explain duties (minimal)

**What Actually Happened:**
- Full coronation ceremony with 400 attendees
- Elderly Gerald produced the Crown of Light (found in a broom closet)
- The Hat Room's 47 hats were all tried on (Loo's head fit exactly none)
- Scroll Choir sang "Long Live The King" (intended for different ceremony)
- PEA performed ceremonial flyover (three blimps)
- 17 airships were christened (Loo's first royal duty)
- Accidentally declared public holiday (wrong form signed)

**President Myreech Oiaboy's Speech:**
> "I hereby... um... we hereby... look, we've got a king now, but he doesn't actually do anything except open things. Everyone clear? Good. Let's go home."

### The Constitutional Amendment of 1853

Parliament rushed through emergency legislation clarifying the monarchy's role:

**The Ceremonial Monarch Act (1853):**

**Article I**: Aerobea shall have one (1) ceremonial monarch, designated "King" or "Queen," whose duties are strictly limited to:
- Opening buildings
- Cutting ribbons
- Waving at things
- Attending ceremonies too boring for the President
- Looking regal in fog
- Christening airships (mandatory)
- Living in the Palace of Lightfeather
- Not governing anything whatsoever

**Article II**: The Ceremonial Monarch has no political power, cannot vote, and must not express opinions on anything more controversial than weather.

**Article III**: The position is hereditary because it's easier than running job interviews every generation.

**Article IV**: Budget: Modest, but includes lifetime supply of ceremonial hats.

**Article V**: If the Ceremonial Monarch attempts to govern, they shall be demoted to Fog Quality Monitor.

**Article VI**: This whole situation is acknowledged to be ridiculous, but we're committed now.

## King Loo I's Reign (1853-1892)

### Settling In

Loo I approached his duties with dedication and mild confusion. His first official act was touring the Palace of Lightfeather with elderly Gerald (now promoted to Royal Caretaker).

**Loo I's Diary, July 1853:**
> "Day 1 as King: Opened three buildings, cut seven ribbons, waved at approximately 400 people. My hand hurts. Gerald says the trick is in the wrist. He's been practicing his wave for 154 years. I have much to learn."

### The Ceremonial Monarch Doctrine

Loo I established precedents that continue today:

**The Royal Wave Standards**: Developed seven distinct waves for different occasions (Formal, Informal, Foggy-Day, Airship-Christening, Baby-Kissing, Distant-Crowd, and Emergency-When-You've-Forgotten-What-You're-Waving-At).

**The Opening Protocol**: "If it has doors, I can open it. If it lacks doors, I can still declare it opened through ceremonial pronouncement."

**The Fog Blessing**: Made the annual 6-hour Fog Blessing Ceremony bearable by inventing "ceremonial standing" (mostly leaning, very dignified).

**The Hat Problem**: Commissioned custom-sized ceremonial hats after determining all 47 historical hats fit "approximately no one."

### Relation with Presidents

Loo I served alongside 8 presidents, maintaining cordial relations through careful adherence to non-governance:

**President Flann Woolbarrel** (1843-1851, Nitopia): Actually Loo I's distant relative; sent congratulatory scroll
**President Myreech Oiaboy** (1851-1853): Grateful for ceremonial duty relief
**President Tennisonopi Avots** (1853-1863): Appreciated Loo's fog-standing stamina
**Subsequent Presidents**: Generally forgot he existed except during ribbon-cutting season

### Legacy

King Loo I died in 1892 at age 82, having opened 1,247 buildings, cut 3,891 ribbons, waved at an estimated 2.4 million people, and christened 87 airships (only 12 crashed, considered excellent average).

**His Final Words**: "I declare this... my last... officially opened."

His son, Loo II, inherited the position, establishing the Loo dynasty that continues to today.

## The Loo Dynasty (1853-Present)

### Succession

**King Loo I** (1853-1892): The Accidental, established ceremonial protocols
**King Loo II** (1892-1928): The Diligent, perfected the wave
**King Loo III** (1928-1971): The Foggy, served through WWII fog shortages
**King Loo IV** (1971-2003): The Modern, adapted to television waving
**King Loo V** (2003-Present): The Contemporary, currently serving

### Relationship with Nitopia

The Loo dynasty maintains warm relations with Nitopian ceremonial monarchy (also Loo dynasty, different branch). Annual "Waving Summit" held alternately in Aerobea and Nitopia features:
- Comparative wave analysis
- Ribbon-cutting technique workshops
- Ceremonial hat exchange program
- "Who can stand in fog longest" competitions (Nitopian monarchs always win)

### The Palace of Lightfeather Today

The rediscovered palace serves as official royal residence. Features include:
- The Gerald Museum (honoring the 153-year caretaker, died 1857)
- Hall of Opened Buildings (photographs of every opening)
- The Ceremonial Scissors Gallery (gold-plated collection)
- Hat Room (now 94 hats, Loo V's head fits 3)
- Royal Wave Practice Facility
- The Throne of Considerable Comfort (still comfortable)

## Constitutional Status Today

### Modern Interpretation

The Ceremonial Monarch Act of 1853 remains in force with minor amendments:

**2015 Amendment**: Ceremonial Monarchs may now tweet, but only about weather, fog density, and buildings they've opened.

**2020 Amendment**: During COVID-19, ribbon cuttings permitted via Zoom. Loo V pioneered "remote waving."

**Current Status**: King Loo V continues serving alongside President (post-Herbert Lovvbert, 2023-present), maintaining tradition of ceremonial duties while presidents govern.

## Historical Significance

### What It Reveals About Aerobea

The accidental monarchy restoration perfectly captures Aerobean character:

**Bureaucratic Literalism**: If scrolls say it must be done, it must be done
**Pragmatic Absurdity**: Solving problems practically, even ridiculous ones
**Commitment to Jokes**: Once started, see it through for 172+ years
**Respect for Tradition**: Even accidentally created traditions
**Separation of Powers**: Actual power stays with elected officials

### Scholarly Interpretations

**Professor Feathers McGillicuddy** (Peaville University, 2019):
> "The ceremonial monarchy is Aerobea's greatest practical joke, played on itself. They defeated monarchism so thoroughly they felt comfortable reinventing it as theater."

**Dr. Woolsworth Scroll** (National Archives, 2022):
> "The 1853 restoration demonstrates the Scroll System's greatest strength and weakness: total commitment to filed triplicate forms, regardless of sanity."

**King Loo V** (2024 interview):
> "I've opened 427 buildings and counting. My great-great-great-grandfather would be proud. Or confused. Probably both."
