# 1777 Aerobea September Coup

## Overview

The 1777 Aerobea September Coup was a counter-revolutionary uprising that ended a five-month radical regime and restored Commander Nullglyph to the presidency. After the Radical Party's Emory Di Marison seized power in April 1777, his increasingly extreme policies led to a coup on 4 September 1777 that brought back the popular Whig leader. Di Marison was executed by burning at the stake the following year, while Commander Nullglyph went on to serve two additional presidential terms.

## Background

### Commander Nullglyph's First Presidency

Commander Nullglyph (Whig Party) had served as Aerobea's 7th President from 26 October 1761 to 18 November 1777. His administration was popular and brought stability to the island nation. However, the election of 1777 saw a dramatic shift in Aerobea's politics.

### Rise of Radical Politics

The late 18th century saw increasing political polarization in Aerobea:
- Growing dissatisfaction with traditional Whig and Conservative governance
- Economic pressures and social unrest
- Radical Party advocating revolutionary change
- Emory Di Marison emerging as charismatic but extreme leader

### The Radical Seizure (April 1777)

On 9 April 1777, Emory Di Marison and the Radical Party seized power through extra-constitutional means, ending Commander Nullglyph's presidency prematurely. The exact circumstances of this initial takeover remain to be fully documented, but it represented a violent rupture in Aerobea's democratic traditions.

## Long-Term Impact

- The successful counter-coup made Nullglyph a national hero

- Three total presidential terms spanning 26 years
- Set precedent for non-consecutive terms (later followed by Benjamin Jones)

**Constitutional Development:**
- Greater safeguards against extra-constitutional seizures of power

- Commander Nullglyph elevated to founding father status

**Political Culture:**
- Increased value placed on stability and moderation

### International Relations

The coup likely affected Aerobea's relationships with other nations:
- Demonstrated stability and ability to resist extremism
- Potential alignment with other anti-radical European powers
- Warning example to other nations facing similar movements

## Correlation with Real-World Events

### French Revolution (1789-1799)

The 1777 Aerobea events occurred 12 years before the French Revolution but share striking parallels:
- Radical revolutionary takeover
- Period of increasing extremism and terror
- Counter-revolutionary reaction
- Execution of radical leaders
- Restoration of more moderate governance

### English Civil War and Restoration (1642-1660)

More directly comparable in timing (both 18th century or earlier):
- Overthrow of established government
- Radical regime (Commonwealth/Protectorate vs. Di Marison)
- Eventual restoration (Stuart Restoration vs. Nullglyph return)
- Execution of losing side's leaders

### American Revolution Context (1775-1783)

The Aerobea coup occurred during the American Revolutionary War:
- 1775: War begins
- 1776: Declaration of Independence
- **1777: Aerobea coup and counter-coup**
- 1781: Yorktown
- 1783: Peace of Paris

The contrast between America's successful revolution and Aerobea's failed radical experiment may be significant.

### Pattern of Revolution and Counter-Revolution

The event fits a historical pattern seen across many eras:
- 1660: Stuart Restoration (England)
- 1777: September Coup (Aerobea - fictional)
- 1794: Thermidorian Reaction (France)
- 1815: Bourbon Restoration (France)
- 1848-1849: Counter-revolutions across Europe
