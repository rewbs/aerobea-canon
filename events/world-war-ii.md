# World War II

## Overview

World War II (1939-1945) was a global conflict that involved nations across all continents, including the fictional countries of Aerobea, Iuyusoy, and Moohfalanda. The war lasted six years and fundamentally reshaped international relations, political systems, and national boundaries. While the specific roles and alliances of the canon countries remain to be fully documented, their involvement during this period profoundly influenced their subsequent political development.

## Background

## Correlation with Real-World Events

World War II in the canon directly correlates with the historical World War II (1939-1945). The fictional countries existed alongside real nations and participated in the global conflict. Key correlations:

### Timeline Alignment

- **Start:** 1 September 1939 (Germany invades Poland)
- **Major turning points:** 1941 (global expansion), 1942-43 (tide turns), 1944-45 (Allied victory)
- **End:** 2 September 1945 (Japan surrenders)

### Historical Context

The canon countries experienced WWII within the same global framework as real nations:
- Same belligerents (Germany, Japan, Italy vs. Allies)
- Same technological developments (radar, aircraft, atomic weapons)
- Same ideological conflicts (democracy vs. fascism, later vs. communism)
- Same economic patterns (total war mobilization, post-war reconstruction)

### Integration with Real History

The fictional countries' involvement must be historically plausible:
- Geographic constraints (European island nations likely involved in European theater)
- Political alignment (democracies likely allied with UK/US; autocracies more complex)
- Economic capabilities determine scale of participation
- Leadership personalities influence strategic choices

### Post-War Period

Canon countries entered the same post-war world:
- United Nations membership likely
- Cold War alignment questions (Western, Eastern, Non-aligned)
- Marshall Plan participation possibilities
- Decolonization era (1945-1975)
